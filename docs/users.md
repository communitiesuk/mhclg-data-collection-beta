# User roles as modelled in the system

## External users

The primary users of the system are external data providing organisations: Local Authorities and Private Registered Providers (Housing Associations). These have 2 main user types:

- Data coordinators – administrators for their own organisation, can also complete logs
- Data providers – complete the logs

Additionally there are Data Protection Officers (DPO), which for some organisations is a separate role, but in our codebase is modelled as an attribute of the user (i.e. a data coordinator or provider can additionally be a DPO). They are responsible for ensuring the organisation has signed the data sharing agreement.

## Internal users

- Customer support (help desk) – can administrate all organisations
- ADD statisticians – primary consumers of the data collected via CDS/DAP
