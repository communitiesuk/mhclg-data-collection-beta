# Supported housing schemes

- **Schemes**: Groups of similar properties in the same location, intended for similar tenants with the same type of support needs, managed in the same way. As some of the information we need about a new tenancy is the same for all new tenancies in the ‘scheme’, users can set up a ‘scheme’ in the CORE system by completing the information once. In Supported Housing forms, the user just supplies the appropriate scheme. This means providers do not have to complete identical information multiple times in each CORE form. Effectively we model these as "templates" or "predefined answer sets"

- **Management groups**: Schemes are often managed together as part of a ‘management group’. An organisation may have multiple management groups, and each management group may have multiple schemes. For Supported Housing logs, users must select the management group first, then select scheme.
