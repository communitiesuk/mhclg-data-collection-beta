# Supported housing schemes

A supported housing scheme (or service) provides shared or self-contained housing for a particular client group, for example younger or vulnerable people. A scheme can be run at multiple locations, and a single location may contain multiple units (for example bedrooms in shared houses or a bungalow with 3 bedrooms).

Logs for supported housing will share a number of similar characteristics at this location. Additional data also needs to be collected specifically regarding the supported housing scheme, such as the type of client groups served and type of support provided.

Asking these questions would require data inputters to re-enter the same information repeatedly and answer more questions than those asked for general needs lettings. Schemes exist in CORE to reduce this burden, and effectively act as predefined answer sets.
