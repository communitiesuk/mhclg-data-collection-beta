# 020: Migration to AWS

GOV.UK PaaS is being decomissioned at the end of this year and by 23 December 2023 all services hosted on GOV.UK PaaS will need to have migrated to an alternate hosting platform.

Like other DLUHC services, we are moving our service directly to DLUHC-owned AWS infrastructure.
