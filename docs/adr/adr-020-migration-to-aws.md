# 020: Migration to AWS

GOV.UK PaaS is being decomissioned at the end of this year and by 23 December 2023 all services hosted on GOV.UK PaaS will need to have migrated to an alternate hosting platform.

Like other MHCLG services, we are moving our service directly to MHCLG-owned AWS infrastructure.
